Besides the sexual assault charges, the 62-year-old actor "has also been
charged with causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without
consent," London's Metropolitan Police said.

The charges date back to incidents that took place between 2003 and 2013. The
investigation by the Metropolitan Police began following allegations that came
out during the #metoo movement.

The Old Vic theater in London, where Spacey had been artistic director between
2004 and 2015, said in 2017 that it had received allegations of inappropriate
behavior from 20 men who had come into contact with the actor at the theater
between 1995 and 2013.

British police first questioned him in 2019. The two-time Oscar winner has
previously said that he will voluntarily appear in court to face the charges.

With Muslims making up just over 14% of India's 1.3 billion population, Modi
will have to juggle the internal outrage as well as external protests from the
Islamic world. Arguably the importance of the business ties between India and
the Gulf is driving the government's reaction.

Indian exports to the GCC nations in 2020-21 stood at $44 billion. These six
countries account for nearly 65% of India's annual remittances of more than $80
billion with some 9 million Indians living in the region. India imports around
40% of its oil from the Gulf. Energy supplies have become even more crucial as
a result of the war in Ukraine. Earlier this year, India signed a comprehensive
trade deal with UAE.

Many of the autocratic countries lecturing India hardly uphold human rights or
freedom of speech. But democracies must strive for higher values. Vitriolic
discussions on many pro-government television news channels, often compared to
Radio Rwanda fanning communal hatred against minorities, must stop.

Protests in a democratic country must remain peaceful without inciting arson
and violence. There can be no justification for public calls for capital
punishment and beheadings by some elected Muslim lawmakers among other
extremist voices.
